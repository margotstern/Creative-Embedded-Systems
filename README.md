# Final Project: Weather Watcher
The inspiration for our project came from my experience living in a shafted apartment. Since I couldn't see outside, it was often difficult to tell what the weather was like. I wanted a quick and easy way to check the conditions outside before leaving my apartment. To solve this problem, we decided to create an interior decor cloud that would display the weather using LED lights. To make this project work, we used an ESP32 that submits an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data for my current location. The Arduino Code then parses the HTTP response, which is a JSON object, to extract relevant weather and temperature information by connecting over Wifi. Based on this data, the colors of the LED lights change to indicate the corresponding weather conditions. For example, if it is sunny, the lights flash yellow, or if it is rainy, the lights flash blue.

- 3 female to female wires


## Getting Started: Software
1. Download Arduino Legacy IDE (1.8.X): https://www.arduino.cc/en/software 
2. Download driver to get port /dev/cu.wchusbserialXXXXXXXX: https://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH34XSER_MAC_ZIP.html
3. Install the `Arduino_JSON` by navigating to Tools --> Manage Library and search for `Arduino_JSON`

## Getting Started: OpenWeatherMap
1. Create a free account at the link: https://openweathermap.org/ 
2. Go to the link: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys to retrieve your account's API key

## Getting Started: Hardware
1. Attach TTGO 
2. Make the following wire connections: LED S (Input Control Signal) -> TTGO 2, LED V (Power Supply) -> top right 3V, LED GND -> TTGO bottom right ground
3. Plug in USB-C into computer and the ESP

## Dowload and Upload Code
1. To Download the code: `git clone https://github.com/margotstern/Creative-Embedded-Systems.git`
2. Open the file `weather.ino` in the Arduino IDE
3. On lines 16 and 17, replace `ssid` with the name of your network and `password` wtih its corresponding password
```
const char* ssid = "REPLACE";
const char* password = "REPLACE"; 
```
4. On line 19, replace `openWeatherMapApiKey` with your personal API key
5. On lines 21, 22, replace the strings with your personal `city` and `countryCode`
6. Select Upload and enjoy :)





# Module 2: Interactive Devices
Here, the goal was to create a interactive art installation that runs of a ESP32 TTGO T-Display. In the spirit of love and positivity in February, My inspiration for my creative embedded system was rooted in sustainability and environmentalism. My system allows the user to control the size and orbit of the sun, earth, and moon. See below the technical specifications to reproduce the work.
