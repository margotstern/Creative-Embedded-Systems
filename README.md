# Module 1: Generative Art
Here, the goal was to create a generative art installation that runs of a ESP32 TTGO T-Display. In the spirit of love and positivity in February, I decided to create generative art from SZAâ€™s acclaimed song, Good Days. See below the technical specifications to reproduce the work.
