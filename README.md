# Module 2: Interactive Devices
Here, the goal was to create a interactive art installation that runs of a ESP32 TTGO T-Display. In the spirit of love and positivity in February, My inspiration for my creative embedded system was rooted in sustainability and environmentalism. My system allows the user to control the size and orbit of the sun, earth, and moon. See below the technical specifications to reproduce the work.

## BOM
- ESP32 TTGO T-display
- USB-C
- Mac (version 13.X)
- Solderless Breadboard
- a joystick
- 5 female to female wires

## Getting Started: Software
1. Download Arduino Legacy IDE (1.8.X): https://www.arduino.cc/en/software 
2. Download driver to get port /dev/cu.wchusbserialXXXXXXXX: https://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH34XSER_MAC_ZIP.html
3. Download Processing https://processing.org/download

## Getting Started: Hardware
1. Attach TTGO and joystick to the breadboard
2. Make the following wire connections: Joystick GND -> bottom right ground on the TTGO, Joystick 5V -> top right 3V, Joystick VRy -> TTGO 27, Joystick VRx -> TTGO 26, Joystick SW  -> TTGO 25
3. Plug in USB-C into computer and the ESP

## Dowload and Upload Code
1. To Download the code: `git clone https://github.com/margotstern/Creative-Embedded-Systems.git`
2. Open the file `module2.ino` in the Arduino IDE and select Upload
3. Opem the file `solarSystem.pde` in Processing IDE and select Run
4. Interact with the joystick and enjoy :)

# Module 1: Generative Art
Here, the goal was to create a generative art installation that runs of a ESP32 TTGO T-Display. In the spirit of love and positivity in February, I decided to create generative art from SZAâ€™s acclaimed song, Good Days. See below the technical specifications to reproduce the work.
